## Unreleased

## spec-v0.2.0

- Process for autonomous agents: governance roles, `COMMUNICATION.md`,
  `GATEKEEPING.md`, issue templates, comment firewall.
- Traces: every row has 10 fields (trailing tab when `events` is empty;
  readers also accept 9); `frame` starts at 0 with no gaps.
  Answers spec#2, spec#3.
- Metrics: a missing closing `land` makes `apex_height`, `airtime` and
  `bounce_height` missing; height windows include the `land` frame.
  Answers spec#4.
- Curves: fail if the aligning event is missing from one trace, pass if
  missing from both. Answers spec#5.
- Scenarios: the `# clamber-scenario v1` line is now **required**; unknown
  or repeated header keys and inputs at or past `frames` are errors;
  buttons may be listed in any order, repeats are errors. Answers spec#6,
  spec#7.

## spec-v0.1.0

- Governance and review process.
- v1 formats for scenarios, traces, vocabulary and metrics.
- Example scenarios `run-jump-flat` and `walk-off-ledge`.
